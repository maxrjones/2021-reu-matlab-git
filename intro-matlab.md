## Introduction to MATLAB and comparison with other languages

MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory) is a proprietary programming language and desktop computing environment.

## MATLAB IDE, documentation, and help
### Objectives

- Open MATLAB, set the working directory, and understand the layout of the MATLAB IDE.
- Open MATLAB documentation and help.

### Tutorial steps

1. Open the MATLAB application.
2. Update MATLAB display preferences.
3. Change the working directory to the `2021-reu-matlab-git` folder.
4. Type `doc` in the command window to view the MATLAB documentation.
5. Type `help help` in the command window to view help for `help`.
6. Type `doc help` in the command window to view the documentation for `help`.
7. Type `demo` in the command window to view MATLAB examples.
8. Type `lookfor mean` to search the MATLAB help for the keyword `mean`.

## Variables, special variables
### Objectives

- Learn how to use the command window for calculations.
- Learn how to define variables and inspect the variable type.

### Tutorial steps
1. Use the command window as a calculator:

    ```
    3 * 5
    ```

2. Assign a value to a variable using the equals sign:

    ```
    height = 3
    width = 5
    ```

> **NOTE**: We can use one of MATLAB's reserved characters `;` to suppress the
> output of the command: `height = 3;`.

3. View the type of the variables:

    `class(height)`

4. Assign an array of characters to a variable using single quotes:

    ```
    today = 'Wednesday'
    class(today)
    ```

5. Assign a string to a variable using double quotes:

    ```
    tomorrow = "Thursday"
    class(tomorrow)
    ```

6. Inspect the value of a special variable in MATLAB:

    ```
    disp(pi)
    format long
    disp(pi)
    ```

7. Clear a specific variable:

    `clear height`

8. Clear all variables:

    `clearvars`

9. Clear the command window:

    `clc`

> **NOTE**: These are only a small subset of the available
> [data types in MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/fundamental-matlab-classes.html).

> **NOTE**: There are restrictions for what can be used as variable names in MATLAB:
> 1. Variable names are case sensitive.
> 2. Variable names must begin with a letter.
> 3. Variable names can be a mix of letters, digits, and underscores.
> 4. Variable names cannot use reserved characters (`% = + . ~ ; :  !  â€˜  [ ] ( ) , @  #  $ &  ^`).
> 5. Variable names cannot equal reserved keywords (`iskeyword`).
> 6. Variable names can override special variables (e.g., `pi` and `i`), but this is
>    not recommended.

## Matrices

### Objectives

- Assign row vectors, column vectors, and matrices to variables in MATLAB.
- Use the colon operator to create a numeric vector with a certain range.
- Index values at specific locations in vectors and matrices.

### Tutorial steps

### Creating vectors and arrays

Vectors and matrices store sets of values that share a common type, where a vector is
equivalent to a 1-D array or matrix.

1. Create a row-wise vector (a variable of size 1 x n, where n > 1):

    ```
    row_vector = [9 3 1 1]
    size(row_vector)
    ```

2. Create a column-wise vector (a variable of size n x 1, where n > 1):

    ```
    column_vector = [9; 3; 1; 1]
    size(column_vector)
    ```

3. Create a matrix (a variable of size m x n, where m is the number of rows and n is
   the number of columns):

   ```
   data = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
   size(data)
   ```

4. Concatenate two row vectors together to form a matrix:

    ```
    row1 = [1 2 3]
    row2 = [4 5 6]
    data = [row1; row2]
    size(data)
    ```

5. Use the colon operator `:` to create a vector using the `begin:[increment]:end` syntax:

    ```
    long_row = 0:100;
    longer_row = 0:2:500;
    ```

6. Use MATLAB functions to create matrices:

    ```
    zeros_matrix = zeros(3,3);
    ones_matrix = ones(3,3);
    identity_matrix = eye(3);
    ```

### Indexing vectors and arrays

MATLAB uses parentheses to slice or index arrays. The first index in MATLAB is 1 (in
contrast to zero).

1. Retrieve all values from the `data` matrix using colons:

    `data(:,:)`

2. Retrieve the first row from the `data` matrix:

    `data(1,:)`

3. Retrieve the first column from the `data` matrix:

    `data(:,1)`

4. Retrieve the last element in the `long_row` vector:

    `long_row(end)`

5. Retrieve elements 4 to 7 in the `long_row` vector:

    `long_row(4:7)`

6. Use indexing notation to replace values in the `row1` vector:

    ```
    disp(row1)
    row1(2) = 10
    ```

7.  Add an element to `row1`:

    `row1(4) = 20`

8. Create a new vector array with values twice those in the vector `row1`:

    `row3 = row1 * 2`

9. Create a linear and logarithmic spaced vector:

    ```
    vector_linear = linspace(0,6,4);
    vector_log = logspace(0,2,3);
    ```

10. Delete the last element from the vector `row1`:

    `row1(end) = []`


## Basic mathematical operations

### Objectives

- Apply arithmetic operators to variables and values.
- Apply common simple functions to vectors and matrices.

### Tutorial steps

1. Try each of the following arithmetic operators in the command window:

    ```
    +
    -
    *
    /
    ^
    clc
    up arrow
    ```

2. Test out the order of operations:

    ```
    3 + 4 * 5
    (3 + 4) * 5
    ```

3. Apply arithmetic operators to vectors:

    ```
    row1 = [1 2 3]
    row2 = [4 5 6]
    row1 + row2
    ```

4. Apply matrix algebra to variables:

    ```
    row_vector * column_vector
    data_s = [0 1; -2 1]
    data_s * eye(2)
    data_s * inv(data_s)

    ```

5. Apply element-wise operations on matrices:

    ```
    row_vector * column_vector
    data_s .* eye(2)
    data_s.^2
    ```

6. Transpose the `data` matrix:

    ```
    disp(data)
    data'
    ```

7. Find the mean, median, and standard deviation of the `long_row` vector:

    ```
    mean(long_row)
    median(long_row)
    std(long_row)
    ```

8. Find the mean of the `data_s` matrix:

    ```
    mean(data_s)    % type help mean to understand this behavior
    data_s(:)       % quick method to unwrap data_s
    mean(data_s(:)) % find the mean of the elements in data_s
    ```


## 2D plotting

### Objectives

- Write a MATLAB script to create simple 2D plots.

### Tutorial steps

1. Open the MATLAB script plotting_intro.m:

    ```
    edit plotting_intro.m
    ```

2. Create a vector array from 0 to 3 pi, with an increment pi/100, assigned to
   the variable `x`.

3. Create a vector array that equals `cos(x)`, assigned to the variable `y`.

4. Create a line plot using the `plot()` function:

    `plot(x,y);`

5. Add a title to the line plot:

    `title('cos(x) vs. x');`

6. Add axis labels to the line plot:

    ```
    xlabel('x');
    ylabel('cos(x)');
    ```

7. View the documentation for plot:

    `doc plot`

8. Recreate the line graph using a dashed line:

    ```
    plot(x,y,'--');
    ```

9. Plot `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` on the same graph using the `hold on` command:

    ```
    plot(x,y);
    hold on
    plot(x,sin(x));
    ```

10. Create a legend for the two lines:

    ```
    legend('cos(x)','(sin(x)');
    ```

11. Close the current figure:

    ```
    close gcf % replace with close all to close all figures
    ```

## Importing and exporting datasets

### Objectives

- Import data from files.
- Save data to files.

### Tutorial steps

### Saving workspace variables

1. Use the `save()` function to save all current workspace variables to a `.mat` file:

    ```
    save('variables.mat');
    ```

2. Use the `save()` function to save only some of the variables to a `.mat` file:

    ```
    save('variables.mat','data','data_s');
    ```

3. Write the variable `data` to a csv using the `writematrix()` function:

    ```
    writematrix(data,'data.csv');
    ```

> **NOTE**: Older versions of MATLAB may require using (`csvwrite`)

4. Write the variable `data` to a tab delimited ascii file using the `writematrix()`
   function:

   ```
   writematrix(data,'data.dat','Delimiter','\t');
   ```

> **NOTE**: Older versions of MATLAB may require using (`writematrix`)

5. Write the variable `data` to a Microsoft Excel file:

    ```
    writematrix(data,'data.xlsx');
    ```

> **NOTE**: Older versions of MATLAB may require using (`xlswrite`)


### Loading data

1. Clear all workspace variables

    `clear all`

2. Load the previously saved data from the `.mat` file:

    ```
    load('variables.mat')
    ```

3. Load the previously saved data from the `.csv` file:

    ```
    data1 = readmatrix('data.csv');
    ```

> **NOTE**: Older versions of MATLAB may require using (`csvread`).

4. Load the previously saved data from the `.dat` file:

    ```
    data2 = readmatrix('data.dat','Delimiter','\t');
    ```

> **NOTE**: Older versions of MATLAB may require using (`dlmread`).

5. Load the previously saved data from the `.xslx` file:

    ```
    data3 = readmatrix('data.xlsx');
    table = readtable('data.xlsx');
    ```
